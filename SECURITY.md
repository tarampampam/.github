# Security Policy

This security policy applies to **all repositories** under the [@tarampampam](https://github.com/tarampampam) GitHub account.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in any project maintained under this account:

1. **Preferred**: Send a detailed report via email to [github@tarampamp.am](mailto:github@tarampamp.am)
2. **Alternatively**: Use GitHub’s [private security advisory form][advisory-form] for the affected repository

[advisory-form]: https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability

Please **do not create public issues or pull requests** that include details of the vulnerability.

Your report should include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability and its potential impact
- Steps to reproduce or proof of concept, if available
- Any known mitigations or temporary workarounds

---

## Disclosure Policy

All security reports are handled through **responsible disclosure**:
- Vulnerabilities must be reported **privately** before public disclosure
- I aim to acknowledge your report within **one week**
- Once verified, I will work to reproduce, fix, and release an update as soon as practical
- Public disclosure will occur only after a fix or mitigation is available, unless otherwise agreed upon

---

## Scope

This policy covers:
- All public and private repositories under the [@tarampampam](https://github.com/tarampampam) GitHub account
- Source code, build configurations, and deployment artifacts published in these repositories

Out of scope:
- Security issues in third-party dependencies. Such vulnerabilities should be reported **upstream** to the original maintainers.

---

## Safe Harbor

I will **not** pursue legal action against security researchers who:
- Make a good faith effort to follow this policy
- Avoid privacy violations, data destruction, and service disruption
- Report vulnerabilities promptly and privately

Your contributions help keep this software ecosystem secure and reliable - thank you.
